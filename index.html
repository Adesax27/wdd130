            The Abidjan Ivory Coast Temple, the first for the nation, was announced in 2015 by
            President Thomas
            S. Monson and dedicated on May 25, 2025, by Elder Ronald A. Rasband of The Church of
            Jesus Christ of
            Latter-day Saints, serving rapidly growing local members who previously traveled to
            Ghana.
            Construction began with a 2018 groundbreaking led by Elder Neil L. Andersen, featuring
            Mid-Century
            Modern design with African elements, and concluded with a public open house in May 2025
            before its
            dedication, symbolizing a spiritual oasis in West Africa.
