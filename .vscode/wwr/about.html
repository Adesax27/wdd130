                    <p>Rafting is an exhilarating outdoor adventure activity that involves
                        navigating a
                        river, often
                        through "whitewater" rapids, using a durable inflatable raft and
                        paddles. It
                        is a
                        popular team sport
                        that requires coordination, communication, and, most importantly,
                        teamwork
                        among a
                        group of 4 to 12
                        people to successfully navigate the water. While it can be an extreme
                        sport
                        on
                        dangerous rivers, it
                        is also highly accessible for beginners, families, and tourists, with
                        many
                        guided,
                        safe, and
                        commercialized options available worldwide.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Rafting began as ancient river transport, evolving with the invention of the
                    rubber
                    raft by John
                    Fremont in the 1840s, leading to the first commercial trips in the 1940s on
                    rivers
                    like the Snake.
                    It gained popularity as a recreational sport in the 1950s-70s, becoming a
                    mainstream
                    adventure with
                    modern synthetic rafts and safety equipment, eventually appearing in the
                    1972
                    Olympics.</p>
